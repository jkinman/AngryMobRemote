Welcome I'm Joel Kinman I made this tech demo to learn WebRTC and practice WebGL while knocking the dust off my matrix math and quaternion skills. 
This app connects the orientation of a mobile phone to the camera in the 3D scene. Some underutilized tech IMO. 

I dropped them into a synthwave / vaporwave edge runner scene I made for fun because it looks pretty RAD!

WebRTC is a real-time communication for the web. It allows browsers to communicate peer to peer with no need for a server (the exception of a peer to peer match maker)
All code, assets and geometry generted by me except the car model I downloaded from sketchfab (credit below)

WebGLâ„¢ is a cross-platform, royalty-free open web standard for a low-level 3D graphics API based on OpenGL ES.
