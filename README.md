# Joel Kinman Static Web Tech Demo (WebGL / WebRTC)
### Welcome. I'm Joel Kinman I made this tech demo to prove an idea I had combining WebRTC and WebGL while knocking the dust off my matrix math and quaternion skills. 

## A few things to note:
- This demo is completly static, there is no server side code running. 
- All communication is done peer to peer. 
- All graphics are rendered in realtime. 

After linking a mobile device by scanning the QR code the device's orientation is linked to the scene's camera.

I dropped the tech into a Synthwave / Vaporwave edge runner scene I made cus it looks DOPE!

**WebRTC** is a real-time communication for the web. It allows browsers to communicate peer to peer with no need for a server (the exception of a peer to peer match maker)
All code, assets and geometry generted by me except the car model I downloaded from sketchfab (credit below)

**WebGLâ„¢** is a cross-platform, royalty-free open web standard for a low-level 3D graphics API based on OpenGL ES.
